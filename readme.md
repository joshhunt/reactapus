## Commands

Uses just webpack to bundle and run.

 * `npm run dev`: Run development environment, complete with [hot module reloading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)
 * `npm run build`: Build a production copy and exit.
 * `npm start`: Start the production server (required build first)


## Caveats

My understanding of React and Redux (and Flux) as very basic at the moment, 
so this code probably doesnt represent all best practices.

I also think the folder structure could make more sense as well, especially around the `client.js`/`server.js`/`serverRoute.js` parts
